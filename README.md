# Real Estate Management System
Real Estate Property Management CRM


Problem Statement

Real estate brokerages often struggle with disconnected systems for managing property listings, tracking potential buyers, and monitoring agent performance. Information is scattered across spreadsheets, emails, and calendars, leading to missed opportunities, inefficient scheduling, and a lack of visibility for managers. Agents have difficulty tracking their sales pipeline, and buyers experience delays.

The solution is a unified Salesforce-based CRM called "PropertyFlow CRM". This system will centralize property and client data, automate key tasks like status updates and scheduling, enforce business processes like offer approvals, and provide real-time dashboards for performance tracking. It will ensure a transparent, efficient sales process from property listing to final sale, improving agent productivity and management oversight.

Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis
Requirement Gathering: Brokerages need a system to manage property listings with their status (Available, Sold), track all potential buyers (Contacts), log every interaction like viewings and offers, and calculate agent commissions.

Stakeholder Analysis: Admin (System setup), Real Estate Agent (manages listings & clients), Brokerage Manager (approves offers, monitors team performance), Buyer (end client).

Business Process Mapping: New Property Listed → Buyer Inquiry → Viewing Scheduled → Offer Submitted → Manager Approval (if needed) → Offer Accepted → Property Status Updated → Sale Closed → Dashboards Updated.

Industry Use Case: Most modern real estate firms use a CRM. This project builds a foundational version of a professional real estate management tool.

AppExchange Exploration: While many complex real estate apps exist on the AppExchange, this project focuses on building a clean, custom solution to learn core Salesforce principles.

Phase 2: Org Setup & Configuration
Setup Developer Org: Name it PropertyFlow CRM.

Company Profile: Add brokerage details, set local currency (e.g., USD, INR), and define business hours (e.g., 9 AM - 6 PM).

Users: Create users for an Admin, a Real Estate Agent (e.g., Jane Doe), and a Brokerage Manager (e.g., John Smith).

Profiles & Roles: Create Real Estate Agent and Brokerage Manager profiles. The Manager role should be above the Agent role in the hierarchy to ensure visibility of records.

OWD & Sharing: Set Property to Public Read/Write, but Offer to Private. This allows all agents to see available properties but keeps financial offers confidential to the agent and their manager.

Sandbox & Deployment: For this project, we'll build directly in the Developer Org. In a real-world scenario, you would build in a Sandbox and deploy to Production using Change Sets.

Phase 3: Data Modeling & Relationships
Objects:

Standard: Contact (for Buyers).

Custom: Property__c, Viewing__c, Offer__c.

Fields:

Property__c: Address, Price, Status (Picklist), Bedrooms.

Viewing__c: Scheduled_Date__c (Date/Time), Status (Picklist), Feedback_Notes__c.

Offer__c: Offer_Amount__c (Currency), Status (Picklist).

Relationships:

Property <-> Viewing (Master-Detail)

Property <-> Offer (Master-Detail)

Contact (Buyer) <-> Viewing (Lookup)

Contact (Buyer) <-> Offer (Lookup)

Record Types: On the Property__c object, you could have record types for "Residential" vs. "Commercial" listings, each with its own page layout.

Schema Builder: Use the Schema Builder to visualize these relationships.

Phase 4: Process Automation (Admin)
Validation Rule: On the Offer__c object, ensure the Offer_Amount__c is not zero or negative.

Approval Process: If an Offer__c's Offer_Amount__c is more than 15% below the related Property__c's Price__c, it must be submitted for approval to the Brokerage Manager.

Flow Builder:

Record-Triggered Flow: When an Offer status changes to "Accepted", automatically update the parent Property's status to "Under Offer".

Screen Flow: Create a "Schedule a Viewing" flow that can be launched from a Property page to quickly create a Viewing record.

Custom Notification: Send an in-app notification to the listing agent when a new offer is submitted for their property.

Phase 5: Apex Programming (Developer)
Trigger: On the Viewing__c object, write a trigger to prevent a new viewing from being scheduled for a property that is already "Sold".

SOQL Queries: Write queries to fetch all "Available" properties within a certain price range.

Batch Apex: Create a nightly batch job that checks for properties that have been on the market for over 180 days and flags them for review by creating a Task for the listing agent.

Scheduled Apex: Every Friday, schedule a job to email the Brokerage Manager a summary report of all new offers received during the week.

Test Classes: Write comprehensive test classes to ensure your triggers and batch jobs have over 75% code coverage and work as expected.

Phase 6: User Interface Development
Lightning App: Create a "PropertyFlow" Lightning App.

Home Page: Customize the Home Page for agents to show a dashboard of their active listings and a list of their open tasks.

Record Pages: On the Property record page, add tabs for "Details" and "Activity". On the Activity tab, show the Related Lists for Viewings and Offers.

Tabs: Add tabs for Properties, Contacts, Viewings, Offers, Reports, and Dashboards.

LWC Components:

Component 1: A "Property Finder" component where a user can enter criteria (e.g., number of bedrooms, price) and see a list of matching available properties.

Component 2: A "Commission Calculator" component on the Offer page that calculates the agent's potential commission based on the Offer_Amount.

Phase 7: Integration & External Access
Google Maps API: On the Property record page, use the Address__c field to display a Google Map of the property's location.

Platform Events: Publish a platform event when a Property's status changes to "Sold". A separate system could subscribe to this event to trigger marketing or financial processes.

Experience Cloud (Portal): A potential extension would be to create a portal for buyers where they can log in, view properties they have been shown, and see the status of their offers.

Phase 8: Data Management & Deployment
Data Import Wizard: Use to import an initial list of 50 sample Contact records (potential buyers).

Data Loader: Use to bulk-upload an initial list of Property__c records from a CSV file.

Duplicate Rules: Create a rule on the Contact object to prevent duplicate buyers from being created based on their email address.

Data Export: Schedule a weekly backup of all key objects.

Phase 9: Reporting, Dashboards & Security Review
Reports:

Properties by Status

Agent Sales Pipeline (Offers grouped by agent and status)

Average Time on Market

Dashboards: Create a "Brokerage Performance Dashboard" with charts showing total sales volume, top-performing agents, and a pipeline of properties under offer.

Dynamic Dashboards: Configure the dashboard to run as the logged-in user, so agents only see their own performance data, while managers see data for the entire team.

Security:

Use Field-Level Security to hide a potential "Commission Amount" field from anyone but the Agent and their Manager.

Enable the Setup Audit Trail to track all administrative changes.

Phase 10: Final Presentation & Demo Day
Pitch: "PropertyFlow CRM centralizes our real estate operations, providing agents with the tools to close deals faster and giving managers the insights to drive growth."

Demo Flow:

Show a property listing.

Use the Screen Flow to quickly schedule a viewing for a buyer.

Create an offer for that buyer.

Show the automated approval process for a low offer.

Accept the offer and show the property's status automatically update.

Finish by showing the updated sales figures on the Brokerage Dashboard.
